How are you feeling today?\nPatient: Good morning, doctor. I’m doing better, but I still have some discomfort now and then.\nPhysician: I understand you were in a car accident last September. Can you walk me through what happened?\nPatient: Yes, it was on September 1st, around 12:30 in the afternoon. I was driving from Cheadle Hulme to Manchester when I had to stop in traffic. Out of nowhere, another car hit me from behind, which pushed my car into the one in front.\nPhysician: That sounds like a strong impact. Were you wearing your seatbelt?\nPatient: Yes, I always do.\nPhysician: What did you feel immediately after the accident?\nPatient: At first, I was just shocked. But then I realized I had hit my head on the steering wheel, and I could feel pain in my neck and back almost right away.\nPhysician: Did you seek medical attention at that time?\nPatient: Yes, I went to Moss Bank Accident and Emergency. They checked me over and said it was a whiplash injury, but they didn’t do any X-rays. They just gave me some advice and sent me home.\nPhysician: How did things progress after that?\nPatient: The first four weeks were rough. My neck and back pain were really bad—I had trouble sleeping and had to take painkillers regularly. It started improving after that, but I had to go through ten sessions of physiotherapy to help with the stiffness and discomfort.\nPhysician: That makes sense. Are you still experiencing pain now?\nPatient: It’s not constant, but I do get occasional backaches. It’s nothing like before, though.\nPhysician: That’s good to hear. Have you noticed any other effects, like anxiety while driving or difficulty concentrating?\nPatient: No, nothing like that. I don’t feel nervous driving, and I haven’t had any emotional issues from the accident.\nPhysician: And how has this impacted your daily life? Work, hobbies, anything like that?\nPatient: I had to take a week off work, but after that, I was back to my usual routine. It hasn’t really stopped me from doing anything.\nPhysician: That’s encouraging. Let’s go ahead and do a physical examination to check your mobility and any lingering pain.\n[Physical Examination Conducted]\nPhysician: Everything looks good. Your neck and back have a full range of movement, and there’s no tenderness or signs of lasting damage. Your muscles and spine seem to be in good condition.\nPatient: That’s a relief!\nPhysician: Yes, your recovery so far has been quite positive. Given your progress, I’d expect you to make a full recovery within six months of the accident. There are no signs of long-term damage or degeneration.\nPatient: That’s great to hear. So, I don’t need to worry about this affecting me in the future?\nPhysician: That’s right. I don’t foresee any long-term impact on your work or daily life. If anything changes or you experience worsening symptoms, you can always come back for a follow-up. But at this point, you’re on track for a full recovery.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate it.\nPhysician: You’re very welcome, Ms. Jones. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything.\n\"\"\"\n\nextractor = MedicalExtractor()\nsummary = extractor.process(transcript)\nprint(json.dumps(summary, indent=2))","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-29T04:20:33.769574Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-29T04:20:33.770647Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-29T04:20:35.867156Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-29T04:20:33.770618Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-29T04:20:35.866452Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Using device: GPU\nLoading models...

I have this nasty cough that just won't go away, and I think I have a fever.\nPhysician: I see. How long has this been going on?\nPatient: It started about five days ago. I thought it was just a cold, but it’s gotten worse. I’m coughing up yellow phlegm now.\nPhysician: Do you have any shortness of breath or chest pain?\nPatient: No chest pain, but I feel a bit wheezy when I breathe deep. It makes me anxious because I have mild asthma.\nPhysician: Okay. Are you taking any medications currently?\nPatient: Just my daily inhaler, but I haven't used it much lately. I took some Tylenol for the fever this morning.\nPhysician: Alright, let’s take a listen to your lungs.\n[Physical Examination Conducted]\nPhysician: I can hear some crackles in your lower right lung and slight wheezing. Your throat looks a bit red, but your ears are clear. It looks like Acute Bronchitis.\nPatient: Is it serious?\nPhysician: It’s an infection in the airways, but you should be fine. Since you have asthma, we need to be careful. I’m going to prescribe a course of antibiotics—Amoxicillin—and I want you to use your Albuterol inhaler every four hours.\nPatient: Okay, sounds good. How long until I feel better?\nPhysician: With the antibiotics, you should see improvement within 48 hours. I expect a full recovery in about ten days.\nPatient: That is a huge relief, thank you doctor.\nPhysician: You're welcome. Get plenty of rest and drink fluids.\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(\"\\n--- 1.
